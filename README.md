# Instructions
* Clone && CD to Repo
* npm install (to get dependencies)
* node server.js (to start server)

# Specs

## Stage 1

* [ ] Repo (your artifact) is created on GitHub
* [ ] Repo follows a conventional file structure for an Express.js app:
* [ ] package.json: standard for any Node.js app; includes package info and lists dependencies
* [ ] server.js: your Express server, with all routes defined
* [ ] views/: for storing your EJS HTML templates
* [ ] public/: for storing static files like CSS and images
* [ ] README.md: includes overview of your repo
* [ ] Express server can be started with $ node server.js
* [ ] Server renders a page at the root route (/)
* [ ] All package dependencies are defined in package.json
* [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license

## Stage 2

* [ ] EJS is installed and set up for HTML templating
* [ ] View template files are created in the /views subdirectory
* [ ] Main view file is called views/index.ejs
* [ ] Main view is rendered at route /
* [ ] Main view shows a list of all artists (see wireframe)
* [ ] Albums view file is called views/albums.ejs
* [ ] Albums view is rendered at route /albums
* [ ] Albums view shows a list of all albums (see wireframe)
* [ ] Songs view file is called views/songs.ejs
* [ ] Songs view is rendered at route /songs
* [ ] Songs view shows a list of all songs (see wireframe)
* [ ] Individual artist view file is called views/artist.ejs
* [ ] Individual artist view is rendered at route /artists/:artist_id
* [ ] Individual artist view shows a list of the artist’s albums (see wireframe)
* [ ] Individual album view file is called views/album.ejs
* [ ] Individual album view is rendered at route /albums/:album_id
* [ ] Individual album view shows a list of the album’s songs (see wireframe)
* [ ] CSS is organized into one or more files in the public/ directory
* [ ] CSS declarations are well-named and formatted (consider using this small guide)

## Stage 3

* [ ] Main view (/) shows all artists from the fake artists data.
* [ ] Main view shows artist name and genre.
* [ ] Artist name on main view links to the artist view (/artists/:artist_id).
* [ ] Album list view (/albums) shows all albums from the fake album data.
* [ ] Album list view shows the name of the artist for each album.
* [ ] Album name on album list view links to the album view (/albums/:album_id).
* [ ] Artist name on album list view links to the artist view (/artists/:artist_id).
* [ ] Song list view (/songs) shows all songs from the fake song data.
* [ ] Song list view shows song title, artist, album, and song length in seconds.
* [ ] Artist view (/artists/:artist_id) shows all albums for the artists with id :artist_id from the fake artist data. Hint: you can filter the albums by their artist_id property.
* [ ] Artist view shows artist name and genre.
* [ ] Artist view shows each album title and year released.
* [ ] Album names on artist view links to the album view (/albums/:album_id).
* [ ] Album view (/albums/:album_id) shows all albums from the fake album data. Hint: you can filter the songs by their album_id property.
* [ ] Album view shows album title, artist name, and year released.
* [ ] Album view each song title, its track number, and length in seconds.
* [ ] Artist name on album view links to the artist view (/artists/:artist_id).

## Stage 4

* [ ] Main view (/) shows an album count for each artist.
* [ ] Album list view (/albums) shows a song count for each album.
* [ ] Artist view (/artists/:artist_id) shows an album count for the artist.
* [ ] Artist view (/artists/:artist_id) shows a song count for each album.
* [ ] Album view (/albums/:album_id) shows a song count for the album.
* [ ] On all views that show song length, the length is shown in mm:ss format. For example, if the song has a length of 286 seconds, then it would be shown as 04:46 (286 seconds = 4 minutes, 46 seconds).
* [ ] Actual album images are used instead of placeholders on albums list (/albums), artist (/artists/:artist_id), and album (/albums/:album_id) views. Hint: once you find an image (Google image search is a good place for this), you can add the URL to the albums.json fake data file.
* [ ] Actual artist profile images are used instead of placeholders on main view (/) and artist view (/artists/:artist_id). Hint: once you find an image (Google image search is a good place for this), you can add the URL to the artists.json fake data file.
* [ ] App uses a CSS framework like Twitter bootstrap or Yahoo’s Pure.css.

## Stage 5

* [ ] All views use an include for the header nav (with links to “Artists”, “Albums” and “Songs”).
* [ ] Header nav include is kept in the file views/layout/header.ejs.
* [ ] Main view (/) uses an artist list item include for each artist.
* [ ] Artists list item include is kept in the file views/artists/list_item.ejs.
* [ ] Albums list view (/albums) uses an album list item include for each album.
* [ ] Albums list item include is kept in the file views/albums/list_item.ejs.
* [ ] Songs list view (/songs) uses a song list item include for each song.
* [ ] Songs list item include is kept in the file views/songs/list_item.ejs.
* [ ] Artist view (/artists/:artist_id) uses an artist album include for each album.
* [ ] Artist album include is kept in the file views/artists/album.ejs.
* [ ] Album view (/albums/:album_id) uses an album song for each album.
* [ ] Album song include is kept in the file views/albums/song.ejs.
* [ ] If you finish early, move into stretch specs, or use the extra time to polish up your code.
